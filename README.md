# daily-planner-app
## Description

In this project my main golas were to

- Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

- Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

- Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

- Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

- Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

- Persist events between refreshes of a page.
